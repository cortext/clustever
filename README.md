# CLUSTEVER

**Clustering for nuts.** Something like a web interface to [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

### Achtung !

+ This software is **not secure**. You shouldn't change the host IP and keep your local installation only local.

+ Work in progress obviously. First **#TODO** is allowing the upload of dataset. Pretty useless until then...

### Installation

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/cortext/clustever
$ cd clustever
$ python api.py # in some terminal
$ python web.py # in some other terminal
```

Open a browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.



##### Thanks

Thanks to @taniki and @JoaquinKeller for the tips ;)
